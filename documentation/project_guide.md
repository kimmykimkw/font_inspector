# Font Inspector â€“ Project Brief

## Project Overview

Font Inspector is a **Desktop Application** built with Electron that analyzes websites and reports which font files are downloaded and actively used. The tool utilizes a headless browser to inspect the network requests of a given website, filters font-related assets, and provides insights by comparing CSS declarations with actual applied fonts. The app supports both individual website inspections and projects containing multiple websites, offering a user-friendly desktop interface, robust backend inspection, and native macOS integration with proper permission handling.

**Authentication**: The app requires Google authentication to ensure user data privacy and personalized experience. Each user's inspections, projects, and history are completely isolated from other users. Access to the application is controlled through an admin-managed approval system with granular permission controls and usage limits.

**Permission System**: The application implements a comprehensive permission checking system that enforces user access controls and usage limits before allowing inspections or project creation. Users receive real-time feedback about their permission status and current usage limits.

**Desktop-First Experience**: The application runs as a native desktop app with full access to system resources, providing better performance for font analysis and seamless integration with the operating system.

**Admin System**: A separate web-based admin application provides comprehensive user management, access control, usage limit configuration, and system monitoring capabilities for administrators.

# CSV Export Font Family Name Fix - Summary

## Issue Description
In the production/dist version of the app, CSV exports were showing "Unknown" or incorrect font family names instead of the proper font family names that appeared correctly in development.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by **Firebase configuration and data retrieval differences** between development and production environments:

1. **Firebase Initialization Issues**: Production environment was failing to properly initialize Firebase due to service account file path issues
2. **Missing Font Face Declarations**: When Firebase wasn't properly initialized, the `fontFaceDeclarations` data wasn't being retrieved correctly
3. **Fallback Logic Masking the Problem**: The CSV export function was falling back to filename-based font name extraction instead of proper CSS @font-face matching

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Firebase Configuration (`src/lib/firebase.ts`)
- **Multiple Fallback Paths**: Added comprehensive service account file detection for production environments
- **Graceful Degradation**: Instead of throwing errors, the system now continues with reduced functionality and clear logging
- **Production Environment Handling**: Improved path resolution for packaged Electron applications

### 2. Robust Service Account Loading (`electron/main.ts`)
- **Environment Variable Loading**: Automatically loads service account data as environment variable in production
- **Multiple Path Attempts**: Tries various locations for the service account file
- **Better Error Handling**: Clear logging and fallback mechanisms

### 3. Enhanced CSV Export Utilities (`src/lib/csv-utils.ts`)
- **Centralized Logic**: Created reusable CSV export functions with comprehensive debugging
- **Advanced Font Family Detection**: Improved matching algorithm between font URLs and @font-face declarations
- **Detailed Logging**: Extensive debug logging to identify data retrieval issues
- **Better Fallback Logic**: Enhanced filename-based font name extraction when CSS data is unavailable

### 4. Updated Context Functions (`src/contexts/InspectionContext.tsx`)
- **Enhanced Debugging**: Added comprehensive logging for CSV export operations
- **Improved Error Handling**: Better error reporting and validation
- **Centralized Processing**: Uses the new CSV utility functions for consistency

### 5. Firebase Configuration Testing (`scripts/test-firebase-config.js`)
- **Environment Validation**: Tests Firebase configuration in both dev and production modes
- **Path Verification**: Checks all possible service account file locations
- **Configuration Recommendations**: Provides specific guidance for fixing issues

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Test Firebase Configuration
```bash
# Test in development mode
npm run test:firebase

# Test in production mode
NODE_ENV=production ELECTRON_APP=true NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=font-inspector FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=https://font-inspector.firebaseio.com npm run test:firebase
```

### 2. Test Development Build
```bash
npm run dev
# Perform an inspection and export CSV to verify font family names are correct
```

### 3. Test Production Build
```bash
npm run build:prod
npm run dist:mac  # or dist:win/dist:linux depending on your platform
# Install and run the generated application
# Perform an inspection and export CSV to verify font family names are correct
```

### 4. Debugging CSV Export Issues
When exporting CSV files, check the browser console (or Electron console) for detailed debug logs:
- `üîç Starting CSV export for inspection:` - Shows the export is starting
- `CSV Export: Processing font URL:` - Shows each font being processed
- `CSV Export: Available @font-face declarations:` - Shows if CSS data is available
- `‚úÖ Found font family match:` - Shows successful font family matching
- `‚ùå No font family match found` - Shows when fallback logic is used

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Development Environment
- Firebase initializes with service account from file
- @font-face declarations are captured during inspection
- CSV exports show correct font family names (e.g., "Roboto", "Open Sans")

### Production Environment
- Firebase initializes with service account from environment variable or file
- All inspection data including @font-face declarations is properly stored and retrieved
- CSV exports show correct font family names identical to development

## Verification Checklist

‚úÖ Firebase configuration test passes in both environments  
‚úÖ Next.js build completes without errors  
‚úÖ Electron build completes without errors  
‚úÖ Development CSV export shows correct font family names  
‚úÖ Production CSV export shows correct font family names  
‚úÖ Console logs show successful @font-face declaration processing  
‚úÖ No "Unknown" font family names in CSV exports (except for legitimate cases)  

## Additional Notes

- The fixes maintain backward compatibility
- Enhanced logging can be reduced in production by modifying the `csv-utils.ts` file
- The Firebase service account file must be present and properly configured
- All environment variables are correctly set in the Electron main process for production

## Troubleshooting

If CSV exports still show "Unknown" font family names:

1. Check Firefox configuration test output for issues
2. Verify the inspection contains `fontFaceDeclarations` data
3. Check console logs for Firebase initialization errors
4. Ensure the service account file is included in the production build
5. Verify environment variables are properly set in production

The enhanced debugging will provide clear indication of where the issue lies in the font family detection pipeline.
